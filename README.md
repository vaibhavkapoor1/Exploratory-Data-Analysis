# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Assignment 4
In this program, we have performed EDA on a set of data of Zomato orders in different countries and we try to take out the highest aggregate rating of the restaurants and plot the data on a graph in order to generate conclusions

The data is taken from the zomato.csv file and the columns that are not required are removed.

Then we merge the data with the country-code file in order to differentiate between the orders of each country.

After this we visualize this data on a histogram to draw conclusions.
